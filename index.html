            <b>Albert Einstein</b> 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists
             
              of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and

              quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed
     
              "the world's most famous equation".

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
          Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.

         His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his 

        uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.

        Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the

       Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium [de]), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he 

        left the German Empire seven years later.
